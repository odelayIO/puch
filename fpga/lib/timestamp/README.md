# Timestamp Module

This module provides a AXI-lite interface which has a register mapped a timestamp register on the [KR260](https://www.xilinx.com/products/som/kria/kr260-robotics-starter-kit.html) carrier board.

The Timestamp module is autogenerated using [Corsair](https://github.com/odelayIO/corsair-reg-map) generator.  The `doc`, `hw`, and `sw` folders are autogenerated from the `timestamp_reg.yaml` file.  These files are committed into the repository, so the end-user doesn't need to install and configure `Corsair`.
