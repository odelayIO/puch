# LED Register File Module

This module provides a AXI-lite interface which has a register mapped to the two user LEDs on the [KR260](https://www.xilinx.com/products/som/kria/kr260-robotics-starter-kit.html) carrier board.

The LED Register module is autogenerated using [Corsair](https://github.com/odelayIO/corsair-reg-map) generator.  The `doc`, `hw`, and `sw` folders are autogenerated from the `led_reg.yaml` file.  These files are committed into the repository, so the end-user doesn't need to install and configure `Corsair`.



## Folder Description

| Folder/File Name | Description                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| doc              | This is autogenerated folder and contains `led_reg.md` file which has all the details of the file register(s). |
| hw               | This is autogenerated folder and contains the VHDL modules.<br /><br />`led_pkg.vhd` : Package file with register map used for simulation<br />`led_reg.vhd` : VHDL register module |
| sw               | This is autogenerated folder and contains the `led_regmap.py` package required for the PYNQ Jupyter Notebook.   <br /><br />`led_reg.py`: Python package file with register map used for Jupyter Notebook. |
| Makefile         | Makefile for building the `led_reg` module using `Corsair`.  |
| csrconfig        | `Corsair` configuration file for Control and Status registers |
